## Realtime Gesture Recognition
A proof of concept to show realtime gesture recognition using the Penny Pincher algorithm, to achieve something like the game Black & White.

This is using the Godot (4.2.1) game-engine and GdScript. Run the root.tscn and off you go. Watch the youtube video for what the gestures are.

### Gesture Templates
There are 2 gesture template libraries res://templates/mandala_templates.txt and res://templates/simple_templates.txt. 
The former is used by root.tscn to demo mandala spell gestures, and the latter is used GestureDemoBehaviour.tscn to demonstrate how the gesture recognition algorithm is working.



Note: This is a proof of concept code base, so it's extremely messy.
